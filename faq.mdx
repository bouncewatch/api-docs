## Frequently Asked Questions

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="How do I get an API key?" icon="key">
    1. Go to [BounceWatch Dashboard](https://bouncewatch.com/api-panel/api-keys)
    2. Sign in or create an account
    3. Your API key will be displayed on the dashboard
    4. Copy it and add to your requests as `X-API-Key` header
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="What's the difference between Cached and Realtime mode?" icon="shuffle">
    **Cached Mode (Default):**
    - Instant response (< 250ms)
    - Returns data from our database
    - Best for high-volume requests and dashboards
    
    **Realtime Mode:**
    - Fresh data collected on-demand
    - Takes 2-10 minutes to complete
    - Results sent via webhook
    - Best for due diligence and critical decisions
    
    ```bash
    # Cached (default)
    GET /api/v1/company/stripe.com
    
    # Realtime
    GET /api/v1/company/stripe.com?mode=realtime
    ```
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="How are credits calculated?" icon="coins">
    Each request costs credits based on modules requested:
    
    | Module | Credits |
    |--------|---------|
    | Base (always included) | 10 |
    | Business | +6 |
    | Technology | +4 |
    | Funding | +10 |
    | Team | +6 |
    | Signals | +16 |
    | Competitors | +8 |
    
    **Example:** Base + Funding + Team = 10 + 10 + 6 = **26 credits**
    
    <Note>
      If you query the same domain within 24 hours, you won't be charged again.
    </Note>
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="What happens if a company is not in your database?" icon="magnifying-glass">
    When you request a domain that's not in our database:
    
    1. We automatically trigger a **realtime enrichment**
    2. You receive a `202 Accepted` response with a `batch_id`
    3. Fresh data is collected and sent to your webhook
    4. You can also poll the status endpoint
    
    This ensures you always get data, even for new companies.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Do credits expire?" icon="clock">
    Credits are tied to your billing cycle:
    
    - **Monthly plans:** Credits reset at the start of each billing month
    - **Pay-as-you-go:** Purchased credits don't expire
    
    Check your credit balance anytime:
    ```bash
    GET /api/v1/account/credits
    ```
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Can I test the API before purchasing?" icon="flask">
    Yes! New accounts receive **1,000 free trial credits** to test the API.
    
    Trial accounts have slightly lower rate limits:
    - 10 requests/minute
    - 200 requests/day
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="What data sources do you use?" icon="database">
    BounceWatch aggregates data from multiple public sources:
    
    - Company websites and blogs
    - LinkedIn company pages
    - News articles and press releases
    - Public funding databases
    - Job boards and career pages
    - Technology detection platforms
    - Government registries and public filings
    - Social media and professional networks
    
    Data freshness varies by source and company activity level.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="How often is the data updated?" icon="rotate">
    Data freshness depends on the company and data type:
    
    | Data Type | Typical Freshness |
    |-----------|-------------------|
    | Base info | 1-4 weeks |
    | Funding | Real-time (when announced) |
    | Team/Jobs | 1-2 weeks |
    | Technology | 2-4 weeks |
    | Signals | Real-time |
    
    Use **Realtime mode** when you need the absolute freshest data.

## Troubleshooting

### Authentication Errors

<Accordion title="401 Unauthorized - Invalid API key" icon="lock" defaultOpen>
  **Problem:** Your API key is not recognized.
  
  **Solutions:**
  1. Check for typos or extra spaces in your API key
  2. Ensure you're using the header `X-API-Key` (case-sensitive)
  3. Verify your key hasn't been regenerated in the dashboard
  4. Make sure the key is from the correct environment (production vs test)
  
  ```bash
  # Correct
  curl -H "X-API-Key: bw_live_abc123..." https://api.bouncewatch.com/api/v1/company/stripe.com
  
  # Wrong header name
  curl -H "Authorization: Bearer bw_live_abc123..." # ❌ Won't work
  curl -H "Api-Key: bw_live_abc123..." # ❌ Won't work
  ```
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="401 Unauthorized - API key missing" icon="key">
  **Problem:** No API key provided in the request.
  
  **Solution:** Add the `X-API-Key` header to your request:
  
  ```bash
  curl -X GET "https://api.bouncewatch.com/api/v1/company/stripe.com" \
    -H "X-API-Key: YOUR_API_KEY"
  ```
</Accordion>

### Credit Errors

<Accordion title="402 Payment Required - Insufficient credits" icon="credit-card">
  **Problem:** Not enough credits for the requested modules.
  
  **Response:**
  ```json
  {
    "success": false,
    "error": "insufficient_credits",
    "message": "Request requires 26 credits, you have 15 remaining",
    "credits_required": 26,
    "credits_available": 15
  }
  ```
  
  **Solutions:**
  1. Request fewer enrichment modules
  2. Purchase additional credits
  3. Wait for monthly credit reset (if on monthly plan)
  4. Check if you recently queried this domain (no charge for 24h)
</Accordion>

### Rate Limit Errors

<Accordion title="429 Too Many Requests - Rate limit exceeded" icon="gauge-high">
  **Problem:** You've exceeded your rate limit.
  
  **Response:**
  ```json
  {
    "success": false,
    "error": "rate_limit_exceeded",
    "message": "Rate limit exceeded. Please retry after 45 seconds.",
    "retry_after": 45
  }
  ```
  
  **Solutions:**
  1. Wait for the `retry_after` period
  2. Implement exponential backoff in your code
  3. Spread requests evenly over time
  4. Upgrade to a higher plan for increased limits
  
  **Rate limits by plan:**
  | Plan | Requests/Minute |
  |------|-----------------|
  | Free Trial | 10 |
  | Starter | 30 |
  | Professional | 60 |
  | Business | 90 |
  | Enterprise | 120 |
</Accordion>

### Domain Errors

<Accordion title="400 Bad Request - Invalid domain format" icon="globe">
  **Problem:** The domain format is not valid.
  
  **Solutions:**
  - Use clean domains without protocols: `stripe.com` ✅
  - Don't include `https://` or `www.`: `https://www.stripe.com` ❌
  - Don't include paths: `stripe.com/about` ❌
  
  ```bash
  # Correct
  GET /api/v1/company/stripe.com
  
  # These also work (we clean them automatically)
  GET /api/v1/company/https://stripe.com
  GET /api/v1/company/www.stripe.com
  ```
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="404 Not Found - Company not found" icon="building">
  **Problem:** The domain exists but we don't have data for it.
  
  **What happens:**
  - For new domains, we automatically trigger realtime enrichment
  - You'll receive a `202 Accepted` with a `batch_id`
  - Data will be sent to your webhook when ready
  
  **If you get this error repeatedly:**
  - The domain might not be a company website
  - The company might be too small or new
  - Check if the domain is spelled correctly
</Accordion>

### Webhook Errors

<Accordion title="Webhooks not being received" icon="bell-slash">
  **Problem:** Your endpoint isn't receiving webhook notifications.
  
  **Checklist:**
  1. **HTTPS required:** Your webhook URL must use HTTPS
  2. **Publicly accessible:** Your endpoint must be reachable from the internet
  3. **Responds quickly:** Return 200 OK within 30 seconds
  4. **Check firewall:** Allow traffic from BounceWatch IPs
  5. **Verify URL:** Ensure the URL is correctly configured
  
  **Test your endpoint:**
  ```bash
  # Use webhook.site for testing
  curl -X POST "https://api.bouncewatch.com/api/v1/account/webhook" \
    -H "X-API-Key: YOUR_API_KEY" \
    -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
    -d '{"webhook_url": "https://webhook.site/YOUR-ID", "events": ["enrichment.completed"]}'
  ```
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Webhook signature verification failing" icon="shield-xmark">
  **Problem:** Your signature validation is rejecting webhooks.
  
  **Common causes:**
  1. **Wrong secret:** Using old webhook secret after regeneration
  2. **Payload modified:** Parsing/reformatting the raw payload before verification
  3. **Clock skew:** Server time significantly different from UTC
  
  **Debug steps:**
  ```javascript
  // Log raw values before verification
  console.log('Timestamp:', timestamp);
  console.log('Signature:', signature);
  console.log('Payload (raw):', payload);
  console.log('Secret (first 10 chars):', secret.substring(0, 10));
  ```
</Accordion>

### Realtime Enrichment Errors

<Accordion title="Enrichment stuck in 'processing' status" icon="spinner">
  **Problem:** Realtime enrichment hasn't completed.
  
  **Expected times:**
  - Most enrichments complete in 3-8 minutes
  - Complex requests with all modules may take up to 12 minutes
  
  **If stuck for over 30 minutes:**
  1. Check the status endpoint for error messages
  2. The domain might have limited public data
  3. Contact support if the issue persists
  
  ```bash
  GET /api/v1/enrichment/{batch_id}/status
  ```
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Enrichment completed but data is sparse" icon="box-open">
  **Problem:** Realtime enrichment completed but some fields are null.
  
  **Reasons:**
  - Company has limited online presence
  - Specific data type not publicly available
  - Company is new or very small
  
  **Tips:**
  - Not all fields are available for all companies
  - Larger, more active companies have more data
  - Some data (funding, team) requires public disclosure
</Accordion>
