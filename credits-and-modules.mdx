## How Credits Work

BounceWatch uses a credit-based pricing system. Each API request consumes credits based on the data modules you request.

<Info>
  **Base data is always included** and costs 10 credits. Additional enrichment modules add to this base cost.
</Info>

## Credit Pricing

| Module | Credits | Description |
|--------|---------|-------------|
| **Base** | 10 | Always included - company identity, contact, location |
| **Business** | +6 | Industry, business model, services, market positioning |
| **Technology** | +4 | Tech stack, frameworks, tools (100+ technologies) |
| **Funding** | +10 | Investment history, investors, valuation |
| **Team** | +6 | Leadership, employees, hiring activity |
| **Signals** | +16 | 40 signal types across 8 categories |
| **Competitors** | +8 | Similar companies, competitive landscape |

<Note>
  **Maximum cost per request:** 60 credits (Base + all enrichment modules)

    Company data doesn't change frequently. Cache responses for 24 hours to save credits.
  </Card>
